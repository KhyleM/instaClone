# Insta-Made
Login handled via React Navigation, and uses a custom API to make sure only authenticated users can access the app. React-native-camera is used to upload pictures to a CDN. Pictures created by users are displayed on there profile, functions just like the regular Instagram app (although not nearly as thoroughly made). Initially made for a class project many months ago.
